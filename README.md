  2. But you **need** Java for this to work
  3. You can download java from [https://www.java.com/en/download/](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
    1. Or if you have homebrew the formula is \&gt;$brew install java
  4. If you do not have java it will give you:
    1. A &#39;no application know how to open this file&#39; (or something like it)
2.
## Access to &#39;HS Schedule for students&#39; Calendar

  1. This is the calendar that Mr.Dale should have sent out to everyone at the beginning of the year
  2. For each day it has a 4 digit number that corresponds to the DDL schedule for the day
  3. If you want to check the ID is:
    1. [isk.ac.ke\_a156g0rub49gp5oiribdta23c4@group.calendar.google.com](mailto:isk.ac.ke_a156g0rub49gp5oiribdta23c4@group.calendar.google.com)

  5. If you do not have this calendar it will error out and should give you a dialogue window

# What to Expect:

1. Mac(and maybe PC depending on your settings) will not open it because it might have malware
  1. This jar was made by me and not a actual developer
  2. Mac does not trust it
  3. You can get around this by right clicking and opening with Jar Launcher
    1. Or going into system preferences =\&gt; security and privacy and then clicking open anyways
2. Dialogue window will open up
  1. You should input the names of your classes for the corresponding block
    1. So if you have Art in block 1 you would type &#39;Art&#39; Next to block 1
  2. If you leave a space blank it will simply not show up in the calendar
    1. Leaving a space blank is fine
  3. The cancel button will quite out of the java application
  4. The Create Calendar button will start the process and take you to a webpage
3. **It will take you to a webpage with big red scary triangle**
  1. **My application and API Oath is still under &#39;review&#39;**
  2. **The page is will be scary and say it is not secure**
  3. **This is**  **okay**  **and expected**
  4. **To get around this you should click the Advanced link in the bottom left hand corner**
  5. **And then click the &#39;Continue To Anders&#39; Class Event Creator&#39; link**
  6. **It will take you to a sign in page**
    1. **Sign into your isk email and allow the application to edit your google Calendar**
  7. This application is fine you can trust it
    1. It is made by someone you know (hopefully)
      1. If not you can hit me up at [aluffman@isk.ac.ke](mailto:aluffman@isk.ac.ke)
    2. If you still don&#39;t trust it you can:
      1. Look at the code here:

4. The webpage will say a simple text line saying you can close it
  1. The java program is running now and adding your classes to your google calendar
